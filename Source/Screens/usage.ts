/**
 * Usage:
 *add the new screen created to its root screen, in Navigation/*Stack
 if for the current screen theres no rootstack present, create one, 
 add the main screen then the newly created screen as the sub-screen

 create the screen with navigation and route as its props, define its types 
 like explained in the Navigation/types.ts, set those types for both navigation
 and route(if required)

 Newly created stacks are needed to be added in the bottom tab, earlier it
 was a single screen, but now it has to be replaced with the stack component.
